This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: the absence of comprehensive error handling within asynchronous route handlers.  The `bug.js` file showcases this issue, where an asynchronous operation (`someAsyncOperation`) is not handled correctly if it throws an error.  The solution (`bugSolution.js`) provides a robust approach to managing errors gracefully and preventing unhandled promise rejections.
